Provide a graph of |u| vs z within the cylinder layer for each Re at a fixed tower length (1 tower)

Figures ?? - ?? show the magnitude of the velocity average across the xy-plane as a function
of height within the cylinder layer. Please provide graphs of |u| vs z within the cylinder layer.
Each of the four graphs corresponds to a different height. Each graph shows the different Re and
domain sizes (for a total of 6 lines in each graph).

We compare the results of the averaged flow as a function of height from the three-dimensional
simulations to the 1D analytical model. To begin, we average the flow across the xy-plane at each
height. We then fit the numerical data to the Brinkmann model using the best choice of the porosity.
Christopher, please add more details.
Figure ?? shows a sample of the averaged velocity magnitude from the numerical data vs.
height compared to the analytical model. Please choose the most interesting cases for this, I will
leave it to you.
Figure ?? shows the best fit porosity coefficients. A shows porosity vs. Re for 1 cylinder at
height 10/64. B shows porosity vs. Re for each of the domain sizes. C and D show porosity vs.
height for each of the Reynolds numbers for domain size 0.125 (C) and domain size 0.25 (D).
To quantify the three-dimensionality of the flow, we calculate the average magnitude of the
z-component of the velocity across the xy-plane as a function of height. Figure ?? shows the
average z-component of the velocity magnitude over the average velocity magnitude as a function
of height for one cylinder at Re = 0.1,1,10 and for cylinder heights 10/64 (A), 20/64 (B), 30/64
(C), and 40/64 (D). Each panel should be a different height. The different Re should be different
lines.
